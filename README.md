# NUSC Website Info
Repository for the Northeastern University Swim Club's Website Code

I started working on this site in May 2015 when I was told that I would be in charge of manually updating the swimmer data on the site after every competition. After creating and finishing a more automated website which stored data in PHP variables (no access to a SQL database) and pulled them to the front end I got word that Northeastern had sadly removed our website in an administrative mix-up.

Faced with a brand new WordPress install I volunteered to create a custom theme to meet the team's needs. Over the past 2 years I have been building and tewaking this theme and the SQL database which goes with it using HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery and the Bootstrap Framework. Some of the data on the website is old or incorrect, but I'm always inching closer to the moving target of a completed site.

The URL to the website is: http://www.northeastern.edu/clubswimming

I think this code showcases my ability to solve real problems using software, as well as my enthusiasm for working on something which I am passionate about.

Thanks for visiting!

# Local Setup
To develop on this site you will need to be a Northeastern student with VPN access. Instructions on how to get this access can be found here: https://its.northeastern.edu/howto/vpn/

Once you've established a VPN connection you will need the FTP configuration to connect to both the codebase and the sql instance. MySqlWorkbench is a free and easy-to-use tool for working with the back-end and any text editor will allow you to write front-end code (although I prefer the Atom editor). FTP config info is intentionally left out of the public repo, but can be attained from anyone currently working on the site.
