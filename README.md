# NUSC Website Info
Repository for the Northeastern University Swim Club's Website Code

URL: http://www.northeastern.edu/clubswimming

# Local Setup
To develop on this site you will need to be a Northeastern student with VPN access. Instructions on how to get this access can be found here: https://its.northeastern.edu/howto/vpn/

Once you've established a VPN connection you will need the FTP configuration to connect to both the codebase and the sql instance. MySqlWorkbench is a free and easy-to-use tool for working with the back-end and any text editor will allow you to write front-end code (although I prefer the Atom editor). FTP config info is intentionally left out of the public repo, but can be attained from anyone currently working on the site.
